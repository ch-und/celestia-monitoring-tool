# celestia-monitoring-tool

After writing [The Blockspace Race â€” Perform my Celestia light node](https://medium.com/@batuoc90/the-blockspace-race-perform-my-celestia-light-node-1f70c24ec866) article, I consulted and rebuilt more comprehensive dashboards. In addition, I integrated `alertmanager` to help users receive alerts about node status via Telegram. Moreover, I put everything into a docker project, so that everyone can deploy it to their node easily.
